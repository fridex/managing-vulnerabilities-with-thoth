== Introduction

In this tutorial, we are going to demonstrate how to manage vulnerabilities in Python applications with https://thoth-station.ninja[Thoth] (https://www.redhat.com/en/topics/devops/what-is-devsecops[AIDevSecOps]) via the Thamos CLI.
This track includes an example of an application which uses Thoth's recommendations to recommend a software stack for specific security requirements. See also https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2022/03/07/manage-python-security-thoths-cloud-based-dependency-resolver[Manage Python security with Thoth's cloud-based dependency resolver] article published.
